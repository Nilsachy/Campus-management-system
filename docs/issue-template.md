# Description
We all appreciate if there is a basic description of what the issue is about. Similarly to how we appreciate it when there's Javadoc for functions.
Make it concise, max 2/3 sentences

# To do
* [ ]  we like to do lists
* [ ]  make each task atomic > creating a whole controller class is no bueno
* [ ]  research has also shown that to do lists longer than about 5 points start becoming inefficient
* [ ]  make new issues if they *are* longer

# DoD
Here a small description of your definition of done. Mention issues that this issue is dependent on, add this in the to do list as well.
